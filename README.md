# Ruchi's Eco-cation Website Repo

## Project Description
We wanted to code a website where we could freely post our research on the environment using the IDE repl.it.
We want to do this because not only is it a passion of ours, it helps to educate others.
Doing this will require learning html, CSS, and JavaScript. In these languages the main things to learn are hyperlinking, adding an image, adding blank lines, creating a box, using different fonts, colors, and alignment for text, etc. 
We anticipate the following challenges: figuring out how to accomplish the more complicated tasks like adding a a box in the exact spot and the exact way we want it.
