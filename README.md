# Ruchi's Eco-cation Website Repo

## Project Description
We wanted to code a website where we could freely post our research on the environment using the IDE repl.it.
We want to do this because not only is it a passion of ours, it helps to educate others.
Doing this will require learning html, CSS, and JavaScript. In these languages the main things to learn are hyperlinking, adding an image, adding blank lines, creating a box, using different fonts, colors, and alignment for text, etc. 
We anticipate the following challenges: figuring out how to accomplish the more complicated tasks like adding a a box in the exact spot and the exact way we want it.

Note: The ones that are just called add files by upload are the members page. The other ones should be named. I had a couple of them go through blank and I did not know how to delete them, so just a heads up they are also there. I have never used Github before so this is quite the learning process.
