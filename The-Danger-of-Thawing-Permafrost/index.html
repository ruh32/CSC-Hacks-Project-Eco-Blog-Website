    The Dangers of Thawing Permafrost
  </p>
  <p class="three">
      Hey everyone! I have returned after a busy few weeks to talk about permafrost! 
<br><br>
Specifically, we are talking about the effects of thawing permafrost. This is an interesting issue that not many people know about, so let's start from the beginning.
<br><br>
According to the Oxford Dictionary, permafrost is a thick subsurface layer of soil that remains frozen throughout the year, occurring chiefly in polar regions. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
The reason permafrost is important is because it contains the carbon-based remains of plants and animals. According to Columbia University, scientists estimate that there are 1,500 billion tons of carbon inside the permafrost. Under the Arctic Ocean alone, scientists have found 60 billion tons of methane (Here's a little video to demonstrate what the methane in the permafrost can do when released: <a href=https://youtu.be/FM0hczFNDZI>https://youtu.be/FM0hczFNDZI</a>). 
<br><br>
As stated by research scientist, Sue Natali, permafrost has "about twice as much carbon in the atmosphere and three times as much carbon than that stored in all the world‚Äôs forests." The thawing of permafrost results in all of this carbon being released into the atmosphere.  
<br><br>
10% of the carbon that defrosts is released as CO2, amounting to 130-150 billion tons. That is equivalent to the current rate of total emissions every year until 2100. In the Arctic especially, things are very worrisome. In November 2019, the North Pole should have been -25 degrees celsius, but the recorded temperatures were 1.2 degrees celsius over freezing. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. 
<br><br>
Mercury is also entering the food chain due to permafrost. The Arctic houses the most mercury on the planet, totaling up to 1,656,000 tons of mercury trapped in permafrost and ice. Mercury exposure may cause serious health problems; Some examples include threats to the development of children and toxic effects on the nervous, digestive, and immune systems. 
<br><br>
Additionally, permafrost contains ancient bacteria and viruses. When it thaws, those bacteria and viruses are spread into the air which can get humans and animals very sick. 
<br><br>
You may think this isn't that big of a deal, but I haven't even gotten into the economic impact of thawing permafrost. It would cost the economy billions of dollars especially as climate change worsens. 
<br><br>
This is a perfect example of how everything is connected. Permafrost is melting because of climate change. As it melts it releases carbon and methane gases into the atmosphere. That is helping to increase the global temperature even more. The increased temperature then melts more permafrost. It‚Äôs a never-ending cycle. This cycle won't stop until we do something about it. 
<br><br>
The best solution would be to stop it at the root cause, climate change. Slowing climate change will slow the thawing. Permafrost needs to be monitored and kept at cold temperatures, but reducing climate change to the best of our ability will make that task easier.
